# Headlines

## About

Headlines is a GUI client to consume data from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/), written in [Rust](https://www.egui.rs/) with the [egui](https://www.rust-lang.org/) framework.

This is a small project that I create to study the language and the technologies related with then. It's also based on the tutorial create by [creativcoder](https://www.youtube.com/c/creativcoder).

## Running the project

After clone this project use `cargo` to run it locally.

```shell
# Clone the project
$ git clone https://github.com/hereisjohnny2/headlines.git

# Run with cargo
$ cargo run
```

> It is necessary to have a **NewsAPI key**, which can be provided [here](https://newsapi.org/register).

The persisted config data will be available at `~/.config/headlines_config`.
